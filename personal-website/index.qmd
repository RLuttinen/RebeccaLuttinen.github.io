# Rebecca Lynn Luttinen

My name is Rebecca (Becca) Luttinen. I am a PhD candidate in Applied Demography at the [University of Texas at San Antonio.](https://hcap.utsa.edu/sociology-and-demography/) I also work as a researcher at the [Institute of Social Research and Data Innovation](https://isrdi.umn.edu/).

## Biography

I grew up in Metro Detroit. I went to Lehigh University for my undergraduate degree where I received a B.A. in International Relations & Economics. I also received a minor in Sustainable Development and a certificate in Global Citizenship. I received an M.S. in Applied Demography from the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I am still a doctoral student.

My research is concerned with women, childbearing people, and children. I study how contextual factors (i.e. climate/ conflict patterns or community gender norms) influence infant/child/ maternal health, fertility decision-making, and gender equity. My doctoral dissertation is on fertility autonomy in Uganda.

Outside of work you can find me running, reading, making ceramics, gardening, or doing a paint by numbers. You can also find me making latte art, as I also work as a part-time barista at a local coffee shop.

I live in Austin, Texas with my partner and our dog.
