    "text": "Biography\nI grew up in Metro Detroit. I went to Lehigh University for my undergraduate degree where I received a B.A. in International Relations & Economics. I also received a minor in Sustainable Development and a certificate in Global Citizenship. I received an M.S. in Applied Demography from the University of Texas at San Antonio, where I am still a doctoral student.\nMy research is concerned with women, childbearing people, and children. I study how contextual factors (i.e. climate/ conflict patterns or community gender norms) influence infant/child/ maternal health, fertility decision-making, and gender equity. My doctoral dissertation is on fertility autonomy in Uganda.\nOutside of work you can find me running, reading, making ceramics, gardening, or doing a paint by numbers. You can also find me making latte art, as I also work as a part-time barista at a local coffee shop.\nI live in Austin, Texas with my partner and our dog."
